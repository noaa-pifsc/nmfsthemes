## Overview

The **unhcrthemes** package provides a `ggplot2` theme and a set of colour palettes for making charts and graphics based on [UNHCR Data Visualization Guidelines](https://www.unhcr.org/brand/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2021/11/UNHCR_Data_Visualization_Guidelines.pdf). The goal of this package is to ease and speed up the creation of charts, while promoting the UNHCR visual identity with a predefined `ggplot` theme, as well as a set of colour palettes and scales.

## Installation

This package is not on yet on CRAN and to install it, you will need the remotes package.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("vidonne/unhcrthemes")
```

## Content

A package with all necessary elements to quickly implement [UNHCR Brand style](https://www.unhcr.org/brand/how-we-look/) in your statistical products and data stories:

1. Adjusted `ggplot2` theme
2. A series of color palette for:
    - A **categorical palette** for UNHCR main data visualization colors
    - A **categorical palette** for people of concern to UNHCR categories
    - A **categorical palette** for geographical regional divisions of UNHCR
    - Six **sequential color palettes** for all the main data visualization colors
    - Two recommended **diverging color palette**

## Fonts

UNHCR uses **Lato** as its main font for publications and data visualizations. **Arial** can also be used as a fallback option if it is not possible to install **Lato** on your computer.


## Usage

```{r load, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(unhcrthemes)
```

### Base ggplot2 theme

```{r plot-theme-data}
data(idp, package = "unhcrthemes")

idp_total <- idp |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(idp = sum(idp, na.rm = TRUE) / 1e6) |>
  ungroup()


glimpse(idp_total)
```

```{r plot-theme}
ggplot(idp_total) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = idp),
    width = 0.8
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Globalement IDP displacement | 2010 - 2020",
    y = "Number of people (in million)",
    caption = "Source: UNHCR Refugee Data Finder\n© UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(10)) +
  theme_unhcr(grid = "Y", axis_title = "y")
```


### UNHCR color palette

All recommended data visualization colors are accessible as **palettes** or **scales** (color/fill).

```{r palette}
display_unhcr_all()
```

### Base theme and color scale

```{r plot-theme-fill}
ggplot(idp_total) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = idp),
    fill = unhcr_pal(n = 1, "pal_blue"),
    width = 0.8
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Globalement IDP displacement | 2010 - 2020",
    y = "Number of people (in million)",
    caption = "Source: UNHCR Refugee Data Finder\n© UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, 0.1))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(10)) +
  theme_unhcr(grid = "Y", axis_title = "y")
```

```{r plot-theme-color-data}
idp_total_sex <- idp |>
  group_by(year, sex) |>
  summarise(idp = sum(idp, na.rm = TRUE) / 1e6) |>
  ungroup()

glimpse(idp_total_sex)
```


```{r plot-theme-color }
ggplot(idp_total_sex) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = idp, fill = sex),
    width = 0.8,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)
  ) +
  scale_fill_unhcr_d(palette = "pal_unhcr") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, 0.1))) +
  labs(
    title = "Globalement IDP displacement | 2010 - 2020",
    y = "Number of people (in million)",
    caption = "Source: UNHCR Refugee Data Finder\n© UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(10)) +
  theme_unhcr(grid = "Y", axis_title = "y")
```

```{r child="man/rmdfragments/unhcrverse.Rmd"}
```
