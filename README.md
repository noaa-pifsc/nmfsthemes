## Overview

The **unhcrthemes** package provides a `ggplot` theme and a set of
colour palettes for making charts and graphics based on [UNHCR Data
Visualization
Guidelines](https://www.unhcr.org/brand/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2021/11/UNHCR_Data_Visualization_Guidelines.pdf).
The goal of this package is to ease and speed up the creation of charts,
while promoting the UNHCR visual identity with a predefined `ggplot`
theme, as well as a set of colour palettes and scales.

## Installation

This package is not on yet on CRAN and to install it, you will need the
remotes package.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("vidonne/unhcrthemes")
```

## Content

A package with all necessary elements to quickly implement [UNHCR Brand
style](https://www.unhcr.org/brand/how-we-look/) in your statistical
products and data stories:

1.  Adjusted `ggplot2` theme
2.  A series of color palette for:
    -   A **categorical palette** for UNHCR main data visualization
        colors
    -   A **categorical palette** for people of concern to UNHCR
        categories
    -   A **categorical palette** for geographical regional divisions of
        UNHCR
    -   Six **sequential color palettes** for all the main data
        visualization colors
    -   Two recommended **diverging color palette**

## Fonts

UNHCR uses **Lato** as its main font for publications and data
visualizations. **Arial** can also be used as a fallback option if it is
not possible to install **Lato** on your computer.

## Usage

``` r
library(ggplot2) # or library(tidyverse)
library(unhcrthemes)
```

### Base ggplot2 theme

``` r
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count", title = "Bar chart example",
       subtitle = "Simple plot to showcase theme_unhcr default style",
       caption = "Data from mtcars") +
  theme_unhcr(font_size = 16, grid = "Y")
```

or **scales** (color/fill).

``` r
display_unhcr_all()
```

### Base theme and color scale

``` r
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(fill = unhcr_pal(n = 1, name = "pal_unhcr")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count", title = "Bar chart example with UNHCR colors",
       subtitle = "Simple plot to showcase theme_unhcr default style",
       caption = "Data from mtcars") +
  theme_unhcr(font_size = 16, grid = "Y")
```

``` r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(gear))) +
  scale_color_unhcr_d(palette = "pal_unhcr") +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count", title = "Scatter plot example with UNHCR colors",
       subtitle = "Simple plot to showcase theme_unhcr default style",
       caption = "Data from mtcars") +
  theme_unhcr(font_size = 16, axis = FALSE)
```
